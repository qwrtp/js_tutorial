A bad penny always turns up.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
Haste makes waste.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
If wishes were fishes then no man would starve.
Once bitten, twice shy.
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
